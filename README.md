# QuantConnect.FXCM

Cross platform implementation of Java Trading API for connecting with FXCM. Uses IKVM to port the Java library to a .NET DLL.

FXConnect uses pInvokes making it unsuitable for a truely cross platform solution. QuantConnect made this wrapper on the java project to enable cross platform work with FXCM execution.
